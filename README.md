Reactive Music Visuals in Java based Processing

Welcome to Hashishen's Music Visual Software

This is an experiementation and creative endeavor to explore all the cool ways to make reactive music visuals in Processing Java

In this Repo you will find the source code written in Processing 4 for windows, along with an exported .exe file with embedded java so you can run the program yourself

Code can be edited in any text editor using Processing Syntax, but must be set up for testing in whatever environment you choose using the designated Processing libraries. This was written in Processing 4, so there is no guarantee older versions may run as smoothly.
